# CampusSpot Design Document

## Project Description
CampusSpot is a web application that helps students find and share study spots on campus. The application focuses on providing detailed information about each study location, including essential features like power outlet availability and noise levels. Students can browse existing spots and contribute new locations to help build a comprehensive database of campus study spaces, rate and review locations, and help others make informed decisions about where to study.

## Project Background
The project was conceived after identifying a need for a centralized system where students could share and discover study spots on campus. Alternative ideas considered included:
- Product Review System
- Campus Navigation Helper

CampusSpot was chosen as it addresses a specific, immediate need within the campus community while providing valuable social and practical benefits to students.
